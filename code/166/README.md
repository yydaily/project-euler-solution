## Criss Cross

A $4x4$ grid is filled with digits $d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9$.

It can be seen that in the grid

$$
\begin{aligned}
&6 &3 &3 &0\\
&5 &0 &4 &3\\
&0 &7 &1 &4\\
&1 &2 &4 &5\\
\end{aligned}
$$

the sum of each row and each column has the value $12$. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also $12$.

In how many ways can you fill a $4x4$ grid with the digits $d, 0 ≤ d ≤ 9$ so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?
