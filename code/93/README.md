## Arithmetic expressions

By using each of the digits from the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, exactly once, and making use of the four arithmetic operations (+, −, *, /) and brackets/parentheses, it is possible to form different positive integer targets.

For example,

$$
\begin{aligned}
&8 = (4 * (1 + 3)) / 2\\
&14 = 4 * (3 + 1 / 2)\\
&19 = 4 * (2 + 3) − 1\\
&36 = 3 * 4 * (2 + 1)\\
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that concatenations of the digits, like $12 + 34$, are not allowed.

Using the set, $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, it is possible to obtain thirty-one different target numbers of which $36$ is the maximum, and each of the numbers $1$ to $28$ can be obtained before encountering the first non-expressible number.

Find the set of four distinct digits, $a < b < c < d$, for which the longest set of consecutive positive integers, $1$ to $n$, can be obtained, giving your answer as a string: *abcd*.
