## Hexadecimal numbers

In the hexadecimal number system numbers are represented using $16$ different digits:

$0$,$1$,$2$,$3$,$4$,$5$,$6$,$7$,$8$,$9$,A,B,C,D,E,F
The hexadecimal number AF when written in the decimal number system equals $10$x$16$+$15$=$175$.

In the $3$-digit hexadecimal numbers $10$A, $1$A$0$, A$10$, and A$01$ the digits $0$,$1$ and A are all present.
Like numbers written in base ten we write hexadecimal numbers without leading zeroes.

How many hexadecimal numbers containing at most sixteen hexadecimal digits exist with all of the digits $0$,$1$, and A present at least once?
Give your answer as a hexadecimal number.

(A,B,C,D,E and F in upper case, without any leading or trailing code that marks the number as hexadecimal and without leading zeroes , e.g. $1$A$3$F and not: $1$a$3$f and not $0$x$1$a$3$f and not $$1$A$3$F and not #$1$A$3$F and not $0000001$A$3$F)
