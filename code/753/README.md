## Fermat Equation

Fermat's Last Theorem states that no three positive integers  $a,  b,  c$  satisfy the equation
$$a^n+b^n=c^n$$
for any integer value of  $n$  greater than $2$.

For this problem we are only considering the case  $n=3$. For certain values of  $p$, it is possible to solve the congruence equation:
$$a^3+b^3 \equiv c^3 \pmod{p}$$
For a prime  $p$, we define  $F(p)$  as the number of integer solutions to this equation for  $1â‰¤a,b,c<p$.

You are given  $F(5)=12$  and  $F(7)=0$.

Find the sum of  $F(p)$  over all primes  $p$  less than  $6\ 000\ 000$.
