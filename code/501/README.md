## Eight Divisors

The eight divisors of $24$ are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $6$, $8$, $12$ and $24$. The ten numbers not exceeding $100$ having exactly eight divisors are $24$, $30$, $40$, $42$, $54$, $56$, $66$, $70$, $78$ and $88$. Let f(n) be the count of numbers not exceeding n with exactly eight divisors.

You are given f($100$) = $10$, f($1000$) = $180$ and f($10^6$) = $224427$.

Find f($10^{12}$).
