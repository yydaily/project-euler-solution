## Eulercoin

Leonhard Euler was born on $15$ April $1707$.

Consider the sequence $1504170715041707n$ mod $4503599627370517$.

An element of this sequence is defined to be an Eulercoin if it is strictly smaller than all previously found Eulercoins.

For example, the first term is $1504170715041707$ which is the first Eulercoin. The second term is $3008341430083414$ which is greater than $1504170715041707$ so is not an Eulercoin. However, the third term is $8912517754604$ which is small enough to be a new Eulercoin.

The sum of the first $2$ Eulercoins is therefore $1513083232796311$.

Find the sum of all Eulercoins.
