## Prime triplets

Build a triangle from all positive integers in the following way:

 1
 2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9 10
11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21
22 23 24 25 26 27 28
29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36
37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45
46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55
56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66
. . .

Each positive integer has up to eight neighbours in the triangle.

A set of three primes is called a prime triplet if one of the three primes has the other two as neighbours in the triangle.

For example, in the second row, the prime numbers 2 and 3 are elements of some prime triplet.

If row 8 is considered, it contains two primes which are elements of some prime triplet, i.e. 29 and 31.
If row 9 is considered, it contains only one prime which is an element of some prime triplet: 37.

Define S(n) as the sum of the primes in row n which are elements of any prime triplet.
Then S(8)=60 and S(9)=37.

You are given that S(10000)=950007619.

Find  S(5678027) + S(7208785).
