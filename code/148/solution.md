## Exploring Pascal's triangle

We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of Pascal's triangle are divisible by $7$:

<center>$ 1 $</center>
<center>$ 1\ \ 1 $</center>
<center>$ 1\ \ 2\ \ 1 $</center>
<center>$ 1\ \ 3\ \ 3\ \ 1 $</center>
<center>$ 1\ \ 4\ \ 6\ \ 4\ \ 1 $</center>
<center>$ 1\ \ 5\ \ 10\ \ 10\ \ 5\ \ 1 $</center>
<center>$ 1\ \ 6\ \ 15\ \ 20\ \ 15\ \ 6\ \ 1 $</center>

However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only $2361$ of the $5050$ entries are not divisible by $7$.

Find the number of entries which are not divisible by $7$ in the first one billion ($10^9$) rows of Pascal's triangle.
