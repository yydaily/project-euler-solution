## Hybrid Integers

An integer of the form $p^qq^p$ with prime numbers $p\ne q$ is called a *hybrid-integer*.
For example, $800=2^55^2$ is a hybrid-integer.

We define $C(n)$ to be the number of hybrid-integers less than or equal to $n$.
You are given $C(800)=2$ and $C(800^{800})=10790$

Find $C(800800^{800800})$
