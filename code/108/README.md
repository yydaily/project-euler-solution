## Diophantine reciprocals I

In the following equation $x, y$, and $n$ are positive integers.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

For $n = 4$ there are exactly three distinct solutions:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{20} &= \frac{1}{4}\\
\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{12} &= \frac{1}{4}\\
\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} &= \frac{1}{4}
\end{aligned}
$$

What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?

NOTE: This problem is an easier version of [Problem 110](https://projecteuler.net/problem=110); it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.
