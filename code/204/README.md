## Generalised Hamming Numbers

A Hamming number is a positive number which has no prime factor larger than $5$.

So the first few Hamming numbers are $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $9$, $10$, $12$, $15$.

There are $1105$ Hamming numbers not exceeding $10^8$.

We will call a positive number a generalised Hamming number of type $n$, if it has no prime factor larger than $n$.

Hence the Hamming numbers are the generalised Hamming numbers of type $5$.

How many generalised Hamming numbers of type $100$ are there which don't exceed $10^9$?
