## Semiprimes

A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For example, $15 = 3 × 5; 9 = 3 × 3; 12 = 2 × 2 × 3$.

There are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors: $4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26$.

How many composite integers, $n < 10^8$, have precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors?
