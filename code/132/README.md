## Large repunit factors

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define $R(k)$ to be a repunit of length $k$.

For example, R($10$) = $1111111111$ = $11$×$41$×$271$×$9091$, and the sum of these prime factors is $9414$.

Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R($10^9$).
