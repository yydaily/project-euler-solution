## 3-Like Numbers

For a positive integer  $n$, define  $f(n)$  to be the number of non-empty substrings of  $n$  that are divisible by $3$. For example, the string "2573" has 10 non-empty substrings, three of which represent numbers that are divisible by 3, namely 57, 573 and 3. So  $f(2573)=3$.

If  $f(n)$  is divisible by 3 then we say that  n  is  *3-like*.

Define  $F(d)$  to be how many  $d$  digit numbers are 3-like. For example,  $d(2)=30$  and  $d(6)=290898$.

Find  $d(10^5)$. Give your answer modulo  $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$.
