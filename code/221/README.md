## Alexandrian Integers

We shall call a positive integer A an "Alexandrian integer", if there exist integers p, q, r such that:

$$
A = p\cdot q\cdot r
$$

and

$$
\frac{1}{A} = \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r}
$$

For example, 630 is an Alexandrian integer ($p=5,q=-7,r=-18$). In fact, 630 is the 6th Alexandrian integer, the first 6 Alexandrian integers being: 6, 42, 120, 156, 420, and 630.

Find the 150000th Alexandrian integer.
