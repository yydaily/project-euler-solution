## Permutations of Project

Consider the alphabet A made out of the letters of the word "project": A={c,e,j,o,p,r,t}.
Let $T(n)$ be the number of strings of length n consisting of letters from A that do not have a substring that is one of the $5040$ permutations of "project".

$T(7)=7^7-7!=818503$.
Find $T(10^{12})$. Give the last $9$ digits of your answer.
