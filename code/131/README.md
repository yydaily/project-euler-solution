## Prime cube partnership

There are some prime values, $p$, for which there exists a positive integer, $n$, such that the expression $n^3 + n^2p$ is a perfect cube.

For example, when $p = 19, 8^3 + 8^2Ã—19 = 12^3$.

What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of $n$ is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.

How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
