## 1000-digit Fibonacci number

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$F_n = F_{n−1} + F_{n−2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.
Hence the first $12$ terms will be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{1} &= 1\\
F_{2} &= 1\\
F_{3} &= 2\\
F_{4} &= 3\\
F_{5} &= 5\\
F_{6} &= 8\\
F_{7} &= 13\\
F_{8} &= 21\\
F_{9} &= 34\\
F_{10} &= 55\\
F_{11} &= 89\\
F_{12} &= 144\\
\end{aligned}
$$

The $12$th term, $F_{12}$, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain $1000$ digits?
