## Pandigital Concatenating Products

Take the number  $6$  and multiply it by each of  $1273$  and  $9854$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
6\times 1273&=7638\\
6\times 9854&=59124
\end{aligned}
$$

By concatenating these products we get the  $1$  to  $9$  pandigital  $763859124$. We will call  $763859124$  the "concatenated product of  $6$  and  ($1273$,$9854$)". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers,  $612739854$, is also  $1$  to  $9$  pandigital.

The same can be done for  $0$  to  $9$  pandigital numbers.

What is the largest  $0$  to  $9$  pandigital  $10$-digit concatenated product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a  $0$  to  $9$  pandigital  $10$-digit number?
