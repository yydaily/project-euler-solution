## Square root convergents

It is possible to show that the square root of two can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction.

$$
\sqrt{2} = 1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\dots }}}
$$



By expanding this for the first four iterations, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&1+\frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5\\
&1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{7}{5} = 1.4\\
&1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2}}} = \frac{17}{12} = 1.416666\dots\\
&1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2+\frac{1}{2}}}} = \frac{41}{29 } = 1.41379\dots
\end{aligned}
$$

The next three expansions are $\frac{90}{70}$, $\frac{239}{169}$, and $\frac{577}{408}$, but the eighth expansion, $\frac{1393}{985}$

, is the first example where the number of digits in the numerator exceeds the number of digits in the denominator.

In the first one-thousand expansions, how many fractions contain a numerator with more digits than the denominator?
