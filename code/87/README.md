## Prime power triples

The smallest number expressible as the sum of a prime square, prime cube, and prime fourth power is $28$. In fact, there are exactly four numbers below fifty that can be expressed in such a way:

$28 = 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4$
$33 = 3^2 + 2^3 + 2^4$
$49 = 5^2 + 2^3 + 2^4$
$47 = 2^2 + 3^3 + 2^4$
