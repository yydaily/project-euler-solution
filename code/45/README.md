## Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal



Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

| Triangle   | $T_n=n(n+1)/2$ | $1$, $3$, $6$, $10$, $15$, ...  |
| ---------- | ---------------| --------------------- |
| Pentagonal | $P_n=n(3n−1)/2$ | $1$, $5$, $12$, $22$, $35$, ... |
| Hexagonal  | $H_n=n(2n−1)$   | $1$, $6$, $15$, $28$, $45$, ... |

It can be verified that $T_{285}$ = $P_{165}$ = $H_{143}$ = $40755$.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
