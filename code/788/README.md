## Dominating Numbers

A *dominating number* is a positive integer that has more than half of its digits equal.

For example, $2022$ is a dominating number because three of its four digits are equal to $2$. But $2021$ is not a dominating number.

Let $D(N)$ be how many dominating numbers are less than $10^N$. For example, $D(4)=603$ and $D(10)=21893256$.

Find $D(2022)$. Give your answer modulo $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$.
