## Squares under a hyperbola


Consider the region constrained by $1 \le  x$  and $0 \le  y  \le  1/x$.

Let $S_1$  be the largest square that can fit under the curve.  
Let $S_2$  be the largest square that fits in the remaining area, and so on.  
Let the  _index_  of $S_n$  be the pair (left, below) indicating the number of squares to the left of $S_n$  and the number of squares below $S_n$.

The diagram shows some such squares labelled by number.  
$S_2$  has one square to its left and none below, so the index of $S_2$  is $(1,0)$.  
It can be seen that the index of $S_{32}$  is $(1,1)$ as is the index of $S_{50}$.  
$50$ is the largest  $n$  for which the index of $S_n$  is $(1,1)$.

What is the largest  $n$  for which the index of Sn  is $(3,3)$?
