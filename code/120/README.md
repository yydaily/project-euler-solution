## Square remainders

Let $r$ be the remainder when $(a−1)^n + (a+1)^n$ is divided by $a^2$.

For example, if $a = 7$ and $n = 3$, then $r = 42: 6^3 + 8^3 = 728 \equiv 42$ mod $49$. And as $n$ varies, so too will $r$, but for $a = 7$ it turns out that $r_{max} = 42$.

For $3 ≤ a ≤ 1000$, find $\sum r_{max}$.
