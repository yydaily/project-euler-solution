## Finding numbers for which the sum of the squares of the digits is a square

For a positive integer $n$, let $f(n)$ be the sum of the squares of the digits (in base $10$) of $n$, e.g.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&f(3) = 3^2 = 9,
&f(25) = 2^2 + 5^2 = 4 + 25 = 29,
&f(442) = 4^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 16 + 16 + 4 = 36
\end{aligned}
$$

Find the last nine digits of the sum of all $n, 0 < n < 10^{20}$, such that $f(n)$ is a perfect square.
