## Pandigital Fibonacci ends

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

$F_n = F_{n−1} + F{n−2}$, where $F_1 = 1$ and $F_2 = 1$.

It turns out that $F_{541}$, which contains $113$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the last nine digits are $1-9$ pandigital (contain all the digits $1$ to $9$, but not necessarily in order). And $F_2749$, which contains $575$ digits, is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits are $1-9$ pandigital.

Given that $F_k$ is the first Fibonacci number for which the first nine digits AND the last nine digits are $1-9$ pandigital, find $k$.
