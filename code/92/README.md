## Square digit chains

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → **1** → **1**  
85 → **89** → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → **89**

Therefore any chain that arrives at $1$ or $89$ will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at $1$ or $89$.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at $89$?
