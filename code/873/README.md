## Words with Gaps

Let  $W(p,q,r)$  be the number of words that can be formed using the letter A  $p$  times, the letter B  $q$  times and the letter C  $r$  times with the condition that every A is separated from every B by at least two Cs. For example, CACACCBB is a valid word for  $W(2,2,4)$  but ACBCACBC is not.

You are given  $W(2,2,4)=32$  and  $W(4,4,44)=13908607644$.

Find  $W(10^6,10^7,10^8)$. Give your answer modulo  $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$.
