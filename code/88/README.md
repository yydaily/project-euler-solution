## Product-sum numbers

A natural number, $N$, that can be written as the sum and product of a given set of at least two natural numbers, $\{a_1, a_2, \dots , a_k\}$ is called a product-sum number: $N = a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_k = a_1 × a_2 × \dots × a_k$.

For example, $6 = 1 + 2 + 3 = 1 × 2 × 3$.

For a given set of size, $k$, we shall call the smallest $N$ with this property a minimal product-sum number. The minimal product-sum numbers for sets of size, $k = 2, 3, 4, 5$, and $6$ are as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}
k=2: 4 = 2 × 2 = 2 + 2
k=3: 6 = 1 × 2 × 3 = 1 + 2 + 3
k=4: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4
k=5: 8 = 1 × 1 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2
k=6: 12 = 1 × 1 × 1 × 1 × 2 × 6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6
\end{aligned}
$$

Hence for $2≤k≤6$, the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers is $4+6+8+12 = 30$; note that $8$ is only counted once in the sum.

In fact, as the complete set of minimal product-sum numbers for $2≤k≤12$ is $\{4, 6, 8, 12, 15, 16\}$, the sum is $61$.

What is the sum of all the minimal product-sum numbers for $2≤k≤12000$?
