## Almost equilateral triangles

It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral length sides and integral area. However, the *almost equilateral triangle* $5$-$5$-$6$ has an area of $12$ square units.

We shall define an *almost equilateral triangle* to be a triangle for which two sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all *almost equilateral triangles* with integral side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion ($1,000,000,000$).
