## Diophantine reciprocals I

In the following equation $x, y$, and $n$ are positive integers.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{x} + \frac{1}{y} = \frac{1}{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

It can be verified that when $n=1260$ there are $113$ distinct solutions and this is the least value of $n$ for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.

What is the least value of $n$ for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?

NOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of [Problem 108](https://projecteuler.net/problem=108) and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.
