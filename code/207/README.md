## Integer partition equations

For some positive integers $k$, there exists an integer partition of the form   $4^t = 2^t + k$,
where $4^t, 2^t$, and $k$ are all positive integers and $t$ is a real number.

The first two such partitions are $4^1 = 2^1 + 2$ and $4^{1.5849625...} = 2^{1.5849625...} + 6$.

Partitions where $t$ is also an integer are called perfect.

For any $m ≥ 1$ let $P(m)$ be the proportion of such partitions that are perfect with $k ≤ m$.
Thus $P(6) = 1/2$.

In the following table are listed some values of $P(m)$

$$
   P(5) = 1/1
   P(10) = 1/2
   P(15) = 2/3
   P(20) = 1/2
   P(25) = 1/2
   P(30) = 2/5
   ...
   P(180) = 1/4
   P(185) = 3/13
$$

Find the smallest $m$ for which $P(m) < 1/12345$
