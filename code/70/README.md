## Totient permutation

Euler's Totient function, $\varphi(n)$ [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$. For example, as $1, 2, 4, 5, 7$, and $8$, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, $\varphi(9)=6$.
The number $1$ is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so $\varphi(1)=1$.

Interestingly, $\varphi(87109)=79180$, and it can be seen that $87109$ is a permutation of $79180$.

Find the value of $n, 1 < n < 10^7$, for which $\varphi(n)$ is a permutation of $n$ and the ratio $n/\varphi(n)$ produces a minimum.
