## Diophantine equation

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:

$x^2 – Dy^2 = 1$

For example, when $D=13$, the minimal solution in $x$ is $649^2 – 13×180^2 = 1$.

It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when $D$ is square.

By finding minimal solutions in $x$ for $D = \{2, 3, 5, 6, 7\}$, we obtain the following:

$3^2 – 2×2^2 = 1$
$2^2 – 3×1^2 = 1$
$9^2 – 5×4^2 = 1$
$5^2 – 6×2^2 = 1$
$8^2 – 7×3^2 = 1$

Hence, by considering minimal solutions in $x$ for $D ≤ 7$, the largest $x$ is obtained when $D=5$.

Find the value of $D ≤ 1000$ in minimal solutions of $x$ for which the largest value of $x$ is obtained.
