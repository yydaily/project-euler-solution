# 2025

For the year $2025$

$$2025 = (20+25)^2$$

Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, the concatenation $ab$ we call a $2025$-number is $ab=(a+b)^2$. 

Other examples are $3025$ and $81$.

Note $9801$ is not a $2025$-number because the concatenation of $98$ and $1$ is $981$. 
Let $T(n)$ be the sum of all $2025$-numbers with $n$ digits or less. You are given $T(4)=5131$.

Find T(16).
