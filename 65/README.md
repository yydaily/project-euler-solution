## Convergents of e

The square root of $2$ can be written as an infinite continued fraction.

$$
\sqrt{2} = 1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \dots}}}}
$$



The infinite continued fraction can be written, $\sqrt{2} = [1;(2)]$, $(2)$ indicates that $2$ repeats *ad infinitum*. In a similar way, $\sqrt{23} = [4;(1,3,1,8)]$.

It turns out that the sequence of partial values of continued fractions for square roots provide the best rational approximations. Let us consider the convergents for $\sqrt{2}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
&1 + \cfrac{1}{2} = \cfrac{3}{2}\\\\
&1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}} = \cfrac{7}{5}\\\\
&1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}} = \cfrac{17}{12}\\\\
&1 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2 + \cfrac{1}{2}}}} = \cfrac{41}{29}\\\\
\end{aligned}
$$



Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for $\sqrt{2}$ are:

$1, \cfrac{3}{2}, \cfrac{7}{5}, \cfrac{17}{12}, \cfrac{41}{29}, \cfrac{99}{70}, \cfrac{239}{169}, \cfrac{577}{408}, \cfrac{1393}{985}, \cfrac{3363}{2378}, \dots$

What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant, $e = [2;1,2,1,1,4,1,1,6,1,\dots,1,2k,1,\dots]$.

The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:

$2,3,\cfrac{8}{3},\cfrac{11}{4},\cfrac{19}{7},\cfrac{87}{32},\cfrac{106}{39},\cfrac{193}{71},\cfrac{1264}{465},\cfrac{1457}{536},\dots$

The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is $1 + 4 + 5 + 7 = 17$.

Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the $100^{th}$ convergent of the continued fraction for $e$.
