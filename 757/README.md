## Stealthy Numbers

A positive integer $N$ is stealthy, if there exist positive integers $a, b, c, d$  such that $ab=cd=N$ and $a+b=c+d+1$.
For example, $36=4 \times 9 = 6 \times 6$ is stealthy.

You are also given that there are $2851$ stealthy numbers not exceeding $10^6$.

How many stealthy numbers are there that don't exceed $10^{14}$?
