## Window into a Matrix

A window into a matrix is a contiguous sub matrix.

Consider a $2\times n$ matrix where every entry is either $0$ or $1$.
Let $A(k, n)$ be the total number of these matrices such that the sum of the entries in every $2\times k$ window is $k$.

You are given that $A(3, 9)=560$ and $A(4, 20)=1060870$.

Find $A(10^8, 10^{16})$. Give your answer modulo $1\ 000\ 000\ 007$.
