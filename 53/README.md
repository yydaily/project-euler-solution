## Combinatoric selections

There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, $12345$:

$123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245,$ and $345$

In combinatorics, we use the notation, $\tbinom{5}{3} = 10$.

In general, $\tbinom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$, where $r\le n$, $n!=n\times(n-1) \times \dots\times 3\times 2\times 1$, and $0!=1$.

It is not until $n=23$, that a value exceeds one-million: $\tbinom{23}{10}=1144066$.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of
$\tbinom{n}{r}$ for $1\le n\le 100$, are greater than one-million?
