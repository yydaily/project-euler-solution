## Square on the Inside

Let $ABCD$ be a quadrilateral whose vertices are lattice points lying on the coordinate axes as follows:

$A(a, 0), B(0, b), C(−c, 0), D(0, −d)$, where $1 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ m$ and $a, b, c, d, m$ are integers.

It can be shown that for $m = 4$ there are exactly $256$ valid ways to construct $ABCD$. Of these $256$ quadrilaterals, $42$ of them strictly contain a square number of lattice points.

How many quadrilaterals $ABCD$ strictly contain a square number of lattice points for $m = 100$?
