## Counting primitive Pythagorean triples

A  **Pythagorean triple**  consists of three positive integers  $a$, $b$  and  $c$  satisfying  $a^2+b^2=c^2$.  

The triple is called primitive if  $a,b$  and  $c$  are relatively prime.  

Let $P(n)$ be the number of  **primitive Pythagorean triples**  with  $a<b<câ‰¤n$.  

For example $P(20) = 3$, since there are three triples: $(3,4,5), (5,12,13)$ and $(8,15,17)$.

You are given that $P(10^6) = 159139$.  

Find $P(3141592653589793)$.
