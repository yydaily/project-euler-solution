## How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?

Some positive integers $n$ have the property that the sum [ $n$ + reverse($n$) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, $36 + 63 = 99$ and $409 + 904 = 1313$. We will call such numbers reversible; so $36, 63, 409$, and $904$ are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either $n$ or reverse($n$).

There are $120$ reversible numbers below one-thousand.

How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion ($10^9$)?
