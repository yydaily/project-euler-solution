## Double-base palindromes

The decimal number, $585 = 1001001001_2$ (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than one million, which are palindromic in base $10$ and base $2$.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)
