## Digit sum numbers

A number where one digit is the sum of the **other** digits is called a *digit sum number or* DS-number for short. For example, $352, 3003$ and $32812$ are DS-numbers.

We define $S(n)$ to be the sum of all DS-numbers of $n$ digits or less.

You are given $S(3)=63270$ and $S(7)=85499991450$.

Find $S(2020)$. Give your answer modulo $10^{16}$.
