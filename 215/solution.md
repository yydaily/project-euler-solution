## Crack-free Walls

Consider the problem of building a wall out of $2×1$ and $3×1$ bricks (horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".

For example, the following $9×3$ wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:

There are eight ways of forming a crack-free $9×3$ wall, written $W(9,3) = 8$.

Calculate $W(32,10)$.
