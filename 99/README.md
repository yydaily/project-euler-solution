## Largest exponential

Comparing two numbers written in index form like $2^{11}$ and $3^7$ is not difficult, as any calculator would confirm that $2^{11} = 2048 < 3^7 = 2187$.

However, confirming that $632382^{518061} > 519432^{525806}$ would be much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.

Using [base_exp.txt](https://projecteuler.net/project/resources/p099_base_exp.txt) (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a $22$K text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.

NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the example given above.
