## FREEFAREA

Let $S$ be the set consisting of the four letters $\{'A', 'E', 'F', 'R'\}$.

For $n\ge 0$, let $S^*(n)$ denote the set of words of length $n$ consisting of letters belonging to $S$.

We designate the words $FREE, FARE, AREA, REEF$ as *keywords*.

Let $f(n)$ be the number of words in $S^*(n)$ that contains all four keywords exactly once.

This first happens for $n=9$, and indeed there is a unique $9$ lettered word that contain each of the keywords once: $FREEFAREA$

So, $f(9) = 1$.

You are also given that $f(15) = 72863$.

Find $f(30)$.
