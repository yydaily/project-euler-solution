## Champernowne's constant

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

$0.123456789101112131415161718192021$...

It can be seen that the $12^{th}$ digit of the fractional part is $1$.

If $d_n$ represents the $n^{th}$ digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

$d_{1} × d_{10} × d_{100} × d_{1000} × d_{10000} × d_{100000} × d_{1000000}$
