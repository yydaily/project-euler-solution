## Distinct powers

Consider all integer combinations of $a^b$ for $2\le a \le 5$ and $2\le b \le 5$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16, 2^5 = 32\\
&3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, 3^4 = 81, 3^5 = 243\\
&4^2=16, 4^3=64, 4^4=256, 4^5=1024\\
&5^2=25, 5^3=125, 5^4=625, 5^5=3125
\end{aligned}
$$

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get the following sequence of $15$ distinct terms:

$4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125$

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for $2\le a \le 100$ and $2\le b \le 100$?
