## Concave triangle

A square is drawn around a circle as shown in the diagram below on the left.  
We shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.  
A line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as shown in the diagram on the right.  
We shall call the orange shaded region a concave triangle.

It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of the L-section.

Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right as shown in the diagram below.

This time the concave triangle occupies approximately $36.46\%$ of the L-section.

If n circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around the n circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of n for which the concave triangle occupies less than $10\%$ of the L-section is $n = 15$.

What is the least value of n for which the concave triangle occupies less than $0.1\%$ of the L-section?
